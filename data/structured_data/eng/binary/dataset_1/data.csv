@wayne230 @AlienNation I wonder which of your favorite talking heads just said that on TV.,0
"@freedomscout @rxwhitmer I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?",0
"The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that ""transgenderism"" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that ""transgenderism"" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding ""transgenderism"" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.",1
"@freedomscout @rxwhitmer Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a ""real thing"" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.",0
"@MollyPitcher1776 Transgenderism is just that, an ""ism"", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say ""real thing"" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.",1
"@freedomscout @rxwhitmer ""Trangenderism"" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong.",0
"@mdr1975 To call some confusion of mind ""real"" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to ""evil"" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?",1
"@freedomscout @mdr1975 Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?",0
"@mdr1975 The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.",0
"@freedomscout @mdr1975 How will you go about ""curing"" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be ""normal"" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide.",0
"@freedomscout @mdr1975 Also they are not ""confused"" as they are well aware of their own bodies.",0
"@AlienNation There is a common misconception that one can somehow ""force"" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes ""mental"" as physical, of the brain, instead of the ""mind"". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.",1
"@freedomscout @AlienNation Again you have not given any viable solution. The ""spiritual counseling"" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.",0
"@AlienNation The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as ""spiritual counselling"" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.",1

"@rxwhitmer So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?",0
"Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, ""science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate"". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to ""put the monkey"" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God.",1

@lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Why should they?,0
@LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Simply because people like you are out to change what is considered moral into something that isn't.,1

"Vaughan cited the case of Sarah Root, who was killed in a car crash in Omaha, Neb., in January after Eswin Mejia slammed his car into hers while he was intoxicated and drag racing. Mejia is an illegal immigrant who arrived into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, and who had several previous brushes with the law, said Vaughan. “The local detectives asked ICE five times for a detainer on Eswin Mejia, but ICE said that he was not a priority for enforcement because he had not been convicted of a serious crime,” Vaughan said. “He was released on bail and disappeared, and is now on ICE’s most wanted list. It was a major scandal for ICE.” In another instance, Johnny Josue Sanchez, 21, a Honduran national in the country illegally who had been arrested three times, allegedly killed five homeless people when he set fire to a vacant building in Los Angeles. In this case, Vaughan said the combination of ICE’s and Los Angeles’s disinterest in removing Sanchez after so-called previous “minor” offenses resulted in tragedy. In yet another case, Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer on July 24, 2015, in her own home. Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, 29, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was arrested six times in the previous 15 months, was one of two men charged in the case.

"Indeed, everywhere one looks into Obama’s background, we find sealed records, scrubbed websites, altered documents, deception and unanswered questions. Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as",0

Even at the DNC convention when a silent prayer was taking place BLM people in the audience jeered during the silent prayer for the fallen officers. Please Hillary supporters explain that one to me. We need law and order in this country. No US citizen black, white, Latino, Asian, has the right to destroy people property without consequences. But it's okay if you are black protesting about a criminal with a gun who refused to put down his gun and was shot and killed by police. What would you have done?",1

Government can't take care of anything. It's time to do away with it all and farm every section out to private sector. Government jobs are all friends and family of mostly unqualified people including President. They make too much money after year jobs are tenured and you can't get rid of them. All they can do is move them to another section and keep paying them for nothing while their job position automatically get step increases. The bigger the government gets the worse our country functions and the worse off the public is.,0
Sanctuary is a function of the Catholic Church. States are not suppose to impose their Religion over the citizens of the US. The people under Sanctuary are suppose to be housed and remain on Church Grounds. At the expense of the Church. Until a determination of resolve between the State and Church can be made concerning the individual. An individual that leaves the Church grounds is subject to the full extent of the Law. The State is liable for the damages caused by the imposing of the Catholic Religion on the people.,0
"@firstonewild When the blatant anti- Christian asault by the Administration and Democrats at every level is ceased then some credence can be accorded to the ""sanctuary"" argument. SANCTUARY cities are run by virulent secularists and Liberals. They are a recruiting ground for ILLEGAL voters and a means to bolster the population for districting purposes. Sadly the American catholic Church is only afactor when some Liberal tenet can be contrived, If the Catholic Church had any real clout every legislator,Pelosi and Biden comes to mind,purporting to be a Catholic and being supporters of any and all legislation supporting abortion and taxpayers paying for it would be publicly excommunicated. That has not happened and the Catholic Church is no longer the bastion of morals that could once influence elections. Sanctuary Cities are the creation of Liberals looking for support from legal minorities. RELIGIONhas nothing to do with it unless you are an amoral athiest...",1
"I think cutting off federal funds to cities who do not enforce current law is a dandy idea. Nothing would make them move faster to fix that sanctuary attitude of aiding and abeting illegals in the commission of a crime - staying here illegally, working here using false papers (fraud) or worse.",0
@pkinsolomons Sanctuary Is a place of refuge for Individuals that are appealing to the people of a State and not the State itself. A plea for personal protection in full recognition of their gilt in the breaking of the laws of a State. A safe zone of apprehension by the People for the protection of all. Where they can safely present their case of circumstances that led them to having no other alternative than to brake the States Laws. For when a State itself is involved in the granting of Sanctuary it is in conflict of interest to itself and the people thereof.,0

I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane. This country would rather name a ship after a gay right activist then a person of the military maybe a person who died defended America. I am sorry but this is just wrong. It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.,1
@dankat2 How does naming a ship after him give gays more clout as you say? The navy decided to name this class of ship after people making significant contributions to civil and human rights. Milk did that for the gay community. There are many other classes of ships named after military personnel.,0

"Judge Napolitano, I must correct you on a talking point I just watched you state on Fox Extra. Your point that South Carolina should remove the Confederate Flag from the State House is wrong, and it surprises me that you failed to do the proper research. The state legislature removed the Confederate Flag from the State House on 1 July 2000. It was then placed BEHIND the Confederate War Memorial on State House grounds to honor the troops from SC who fought for the Confederacy, right where it belongs. In the future, PLEASE do your research before spouting off like a liberal.",0
"The flag means different things to different people, especially people that do not live in the south and do not understand southerners or their heritage. I have no hate for any race, I try to avoid ticking off others by using racial comments in public just as I try to avoid cussing at the office. But don't understand how 13% of the population can tell the rest of us that we have to believe what they believe, and we cannot honor our ancestors who fought the North in the civil war by flying a flag on our private residence if we choose to. Two weeks ago I started flying both the American flag as well as the confederate battle flag daily. Don't like it, make your opinions known from the street, touch my flag and I'll defend my possessions as its attached to my house. Since I started flying it, 5 other neighbors have started flying theirs as well. All of which used to fly the American flag on flag day, holidays, and anytime it felt right to do so, now they all fly the Rebel flag(battle flag) as we feel we are under attack, not from minorities who live in the south, but once again from activists from the North, forcing their opinions and rules and regulations on us where they have no right to do so. I am rebelling against that in the easiest way I can, by flying a flag that I have displayed on my first car for 40 years, and flying the flag of my College, and the confederacy...regardless if it lost a war or not. The North cannot abolish southern values or heritage, even if they want to protest our government buildings, try it in the suburbs and see what type of response you get.",0

The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.,0
"@TheGrimlock1369 The Federal Government violates the constitution left and right. Read the Judge's piece, ""Imagine America without the Constitution"" to see just a few clear examples. Our nation was intended to be one of numerous separate sovereign States, yielded limited authority to a central government for the purpose of patrolling the coasts for piracy, minting currency, and other things that a Federal government would be able to do more efficiently than all the States separately. Lincoln would undoubtedly role over in his grave if he would have seen how the Federal Government would have used the Civil War to strip states of their rights and powers… The Federal government just votes itself more power year after year.",0

"On April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. ● 10 million+ Estimated number of Native Americans living in land that is now the United States when European explorers first arrived in the 15th century ● Less than 300,000 Estimated number of Native Americans living in the United States around 1900 4 Million Slaves in 1860 who granted had a bad 100+ years even after slavery ""ended"", or dropping a continents entire population to 0.3% of it's original number.... Maybe we should be more concerned with the atrocities done to the natives of America. Maybe they should be slightly more offended by the flag flying over the White House. Many people who love the constitution would prefer the Gadsen Flag (Don't Tread on Me) replace the old, clearly offensive, stars and bars design anyway. Hug an ancestor of a slave.

Remember Trail of Tears and women giving birth or having miscarriages along the way, marched every day across hundreds of miles. Deliberately infected blankets with smallpox given to old men, women, children, in order to wage germ warfare against them. Deliberate bombing of civilian centers in Germany and Japan instead of only industrial targets. Thousands wiped out in a fiery holocaust in just 2 days in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using atomic weapons. Yes, if there's a flag that should be retired because it's displayed hate and excess of bloodshed it's the Stars and Stripes.

"barker @flrlegal The ""whole purpose"" was not slavery, and the vast majority of those who fought for the South did not own slaves. Many were ambivalent with respect to it. But, what drove the conflict most was the idea that the States were not subservient to the United States, and had a contractual right to withdraw from it. New York was the first to test this during the first ""civil war"" of 1812, when NY's legislature drafted articles of succession. Had the Brits decided to back off after burning D.C., NY and other Eastern States may have tried to leave the Union. The Southern States might have said ""good riddance"". The issue of the Confederacy certainly contained the ongoing issue of slavery, but its primary issue was ""States rights"", a battle that continues to this day.",0

"Using income as a way to diversify a student body is an alternative to race-based admissions, but only if the college has a strong endowment and a commitment to financial aid. One of the most respected colleges in the country, Haverford College, just announced that they are no longer need-blind in their admissions process due to budgetary concerns. There are very few colleges truly equipped to fund low-income students in a way that doesn't saddle them with debt for the rest of their lives. If income is the new strategy to create diversity, colleges need to do a better job of making the cost of an education more affordable. And, that seems unlikely at most institutions",0

I stated each company by name and the number of positions open and asked why these people couldn't go to work to fulfill the ""quota"" so I could take a position with one of the companies I had listed. The person behind the counter was a ""person of color"" and her response was short and to the point. I needed to move along so the next person could receive their benefit check.

"S. @mastersundholm I got laid off from my job last December. I was making $87,000 a year and my wife only makes $32,000. I tried to go for unemployment in Pennsylvania and was declined because I made too much money. They seriously denied me unemployment because I made too much money at what was my previous job. They said I had to wait 3 months before I would qualify!!! I told them I have no income the day after my last day at work. They still did not care. Getting laid off in December is the worst month to get laid off in. Took me two months to find a job that is making what I was previously. Now because I could not qualify for unemployment I did pick up side jobs with a family member that did residential electrical work. Otherwise my bills would have defaulted.",0

On my dime as a taxpayer. I have been working since 1965. I used food stamps once for 3 months to feed my child while I looked for a new job in 1971. But it had limits & you could not buy frivolous junk food. Too many of the current EBT users are able bodied spoiled people who could & should pay their own way. I think we need better screening and their should be a limited list of what they can purchase with EBT cards. Fruit vegetables beans eggs & milk etc. From a nurse in Oregon.",1
"Nurse, I had the same experience many years ago. The expensively dressed woman in front of me had a buggy full of steaks, pork chops, roasts, and premium ice cream, and she paid with ""food stamps."" I was a teacher and my husband was employed by a bank. I was buying ground beef for casseroles and ""ice milk"" (remember that?) for my two-year-old's birthday party. I witness this much more often now. Since Obama claims unemployment is so low now, why can't counties and states partner with businesses to trade EBT cards for temporary work or day jobs, or something on that order? It's gotten ridiculous.",0

And those in public housing, getting free electricity, cell phones, etc. should also have to work. If nothing else, there is plenty of litter along the highways to pick up.",0
"I was on welfare and incapable of working at one time but signed up for a few hours volunteer work a couple of times a week. It made me feel that I 'gave back' as much as I was capable, and that I was actually still engaged with life, with people, that I could offer something needed, even as I was in need. I was very appreciate of having the help available until I could get back on my feet but a 'welfare life' deforms your spirit, if its not already deformed enough to find that life acceptable. The essentials of power, transport, etc are so expensive, and the knockbacks so demoralising and the eventual inertia so debilitating, that sometimes you sink into despondency. If eligable welfare recipients were matched up with something they could align to personally ( I worked at a farm and an emergency relief food outlet , both which I liked), i could see it working for all concerned. Unfortunately, I could see this becoming an almost work-for - the-state situation and taken to its end-point, that gives me the heebie jeebies.",0
"@Songkran and your experience is exactly what welfare should be. Temporary, empowering. it is depressing being unemployed. working those hours not only give back to the economy, they do wonders for your self esteem and help you back into the work force. these free loaders that use welfare as a way of life as they work under the table are the real problem, and under obama it seems that the handouts have gotten out of control. turning into a welfare state.",0

@opaque/584efea0-7ff6-11e2-bb02-000f20980440 @Songkran I personally know people who get $800+ in food stamps claiming children who do not live with them. They sell them for cash drugs liquor and cigarettes. They sleep all day and party all night. Then their are those who are actually trying to get ahead that are denied any benefits or less than $100 a month help and working 2 to 3 jobs. Need better screening and follow up inspections.,1

Sometimes it's as simple as tree stumps being removed to make, as in this case, a man made lake. The owners don't want people hurt on the remaining stumps until they have rotted away. They walked together on a beach and the little boy was in less than 12"" of water. Now if the signs that were posted would have said ""DANGER ALLIGATORS IN WATER"" I could see how you might have a point. However, you do not.",0

"@Hunneyblonde seriously? Now I live in the South and if there is a public area that has ALLIGATORS we post signs that state that....Now if I am going to ""Disney"" I would NOT expect at a resort type hotel for there to be Gators and if there are they should POST that because someone from some Northern state on vacation is not thinking Gators unless they are at Animal Kingdom.....this is clearly the fault of the hotel not the parents....and it was an accident",0

@InventPeace It's a COOKBOOK!,0
"FL protects alligators too much, alligators are serial killers, they eat anything anyone any pet, they can. Sad the media has convinced the public that these killers should be ""protected by law""? Hope they learn why some creatures are not desirable neighbors? They should all be re-located to the Everglades (the gators and the media, lol), that would help their tourism and make the rest of FL safer. Same for the Bear issues, Over Development destroys the Bears natural habitat so they have to search for food more and farther, so its mans doing; just Re-Locate them to the Rockies perhaps, that would not require the Bears killed,who are only looking for food most all the times. Too, Disney should have 2 barriers between any dangerous animal or creature and the public. Even a good parent can be caught unawares. Its just human nature to not always be 100% on guard.",0
