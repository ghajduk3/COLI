564669155383586816,verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
564669505012375552,"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
564669757735960576,the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.
564669978591260672,"add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch)."
564670175828377600,does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.

564671993929166849,@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.

564672521778126848,@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
564672790540742656,@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
564672916965433346,@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #.
564673679041118210,it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
564673810356379648,pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE

561410740913860608,"@ingyusarms Read the Tao Te Ching, or read up on Zen, or read the Upanishads and it will begin to give you an idea about spirituality."
